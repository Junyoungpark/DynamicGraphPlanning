# Dynamic Graph Planning

We propose a framework for planning over graph-structured data. The main challenge is associated with the required temporal logic to reason about future states of the graph.
In short, given a graph,  how can we influence it to our liking? We will be using the spread and control of the COVID-19 pandemic as our motivating example problem.
